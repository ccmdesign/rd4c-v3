      <h2>Data about children is everywhere</h2>
      <p>Today’s digital age is marked by major advances in how we record major events—at birth, at the doctor, at school, in the home, and when children ask for help. These advances have been key in ensuring that the rights and welfare of children are upheld from the outset of their lives. They ensure access to health care, education, legal protection, and other essential services.</p>
      <p>However, this increased visibility, enabled by the constant accumulation of digital information, also introduces incredible challenges. The very data that institutions use to help children can also be abused and misused, threatening children’s privacy and security or making them vulnerable to harm.</p>
      <p>These facts raise a dilemma: How can we promote the good use of data while minimizing harm? </p>
      <p>What do government agencies, international organizations, civil society organizations, and everyday people need to handle data responsibly, effectively, and in ways that are consistent with children’s wants and needs?</p>
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Responsible Data for Children is an initiative launched by The Governance Lab at New York University and UNICEF that seeks to promote responsible handling of data for and about children. </p>
      <p>Through this site, we offer a suite of tools and resources that allow senior officials, project managers, children’s advocates, and everyday people with the knowledge they need to ensure children’s rights and interests remain a central part of our digital world. </p>
      <p>We also offer information on some of our collaborations around the globe, including our projects with governments, UN country offices, civil society groups, and others who play an integral part in promoting the potential of the next generation. </p>

      <h2>Our Approach At a Glance</h2>
      <p>Responsible Data for Children seeks to build awareness regarding the need for special attention to data issues affecting children—especially in this age of changing technology and data linkage. It is unique in that it adopts a principle-led approach to data responsibility. </p>
      <p>Recognizing that each country has its own policies and directives around data, we seek to be a useful supplement, providing a framework that can be flexible and fill in the gaps that might be left by the more “rigid” requirements.</p>
      <p>This approach allows us to be more approachable, meeting organizations where they are, and aspirational, providing a “North Star” that organizations can navigate toward.</p>
      <p>This principle-led approach was developed by UNICEF and The GovLab after extensive research, visits to partners, and discussion with our network of experts. We’ve used the principles in projects with UNHCR and others.</p>

      <h2>Our Principles:</h2>
      <p>Participatory: Engaging and informing individuals and groups affected by the use of data for and about children.</p>
      <p>Professionally Accountable: Operationalizing responsible data practices and principles by establishing institutional processes, roles, and responsibilities.</p>
      <p>People-Centric: Ensuring the needs and expectations of children, their caregivers, and their communities are prioritized by actors handling data for and about them.</p>
      <p>Prevention of Harms Across the Data Lifecycle: Establishing end-to-end data responsibility by assessing risks during the collecting, storing, preparing, sharing, analyzing, and using stages of the data life cycle.</p>
      <p>Proportional: Aligning the breadth of data collection and duration of data retention with the intended purpose.</p>
      <p>Protective of Children’s Rights: Recognizing the distinct rights and requirements for helping children develop to their full potential.</p>
      <p>Purpose-Driven: Identifying and specifying why the data is needed and how the intended or potential benefits relate to improving children’s lives.</p>

      <h2>Testimonials</h2>
      <p>We look for opportunities to support youth and their advocates around the globe. In 2024, we spoke to a handful of our partners and asked them to describe what the Responsible Data for Children approach meant to them.</p>
